This data often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your computer, but it can contain other information as well. Some cookies are placed by third parties acting on our behalf. We use cookies and similar technologies to store and honor your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, provide interest-based advertising, combat fraud, analyze how our products perform, and fulfill other legitimate purposes described below. START.GG uses additional identifiers for similar purposes, and many of our websites and applications also contain web beacons or other similar technologies, as described below.</p><b>Our use of cookies and similar technologies</b><ul><li><b>Performance.</b> START.GG uses cookies to understand and improve how our products perform. For example, we use cookies to gather data that helps with load balancing; this helps us keep our websites remain up and running. In addition, we may use cookies to determine where to route your traffic to effectively distribute the Site workload across numerous servers.</li><li><b>Analytics.</b> We use first- and third-party cookies and other identifiers to gather usage and performance data. For example, we use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service and to develop other statistics about the operations of our products. We also use these technologies and allow third parties to monitor our Services and to analyze how you use our Services. For example, we may place cookies that allow us (a) to measure the time of your requests to our servers and our responses; (b) to A/B test new features; (c) to record statistics about site usage; (d) to track your activities on the Services; and (e) to track the places from which you come to the Services. We may also use third party cookies to collect information about visitor behavior on our Services for these Performance/Analytics purposes.</li><li><b>Storing your preferences and settings.</b> We use these technologies and allow third parties to use these technologies to store your preferences and settings on your device, and to enhance your experiences. For example, to provide a quick link to recently-visited Tournaments in the left side navigation, we store the most recent Tournaments you’ve visited in a cookie. Saving your preferences with cookies, such as your preferred language, prevents you from having to set your preferences repeatedly. Similarly, in scenarios where we obtain your consent to place cookies on your device, we store your choice in a cookie.</li><li><b>Social media.</b> START.GG uses social media cookies, including those that enable users who are signed in to the social media service to share content via that service.</li><li><b>Storing information you provide to a website.</b> We use cookies to remember information you shared.

Please refer to your web browser&#x27;s help section for information on how to do this.</p><b>Our use of web beacons and other technologies</b><ul><li><b>Pixel tags (also known as clear GIFs or web beacons).</b> A pixel tag is a tiny invisible tag or graphic placed on certain parts of the Services or other websites, in emails or in certain other downloadable content, but not on your computer, mobile device or browser, except to the extent that you download the content that contains such tags. Pixel tags do not store data on your computer, mobile device or browser (although they are occasionally downloaded to your computer if contained in an email or other downloadable content) so cannot be managed by you except by deleting the content in which the tag is contained.</li><li><b>Local shared objects (also known as flash cookies).</b> A local shared object is similar to a cookie, except it is stored on your computer or mobile device, instead of your browser, and it can store more than just text.
